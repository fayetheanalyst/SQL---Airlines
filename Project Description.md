### Project Overview: Best Performing Airline Project


Dear Client,

I understand you manage multiple warehouse locations and need an optimal airline for employee travel between these sites. To assist you in this endeavor, I've analyzed data from the "U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics Airline" database between the years 2013 and 2015.

My analysis focused on several key criteria, including the total number of flights per airline, unique airports served, punctuality in departures within a 15-minute window, and the frequency of canceled, delayed, and diverted flights. Leveraging SQL, I calculated these metrics and visualized the results using Tableau.

After a thorough examination, Delta Airlines emerged as the top recommendation. It ranked second in the number of flights and diverse airport coverage. Furthermore, it has the most timely departures and the lowest portion of flight cancellations, diversions, and delays. Therefore, Delta Airlines is the most suitable choice for ensuring smooth employee transportation across your various locations.


Best regards,
